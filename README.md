# Description
This is a simple extension/userscript that displays a subscription rate and a favorite rate on a mod's page alongside unique visitors, current subscriptions and current favorites.

# How it works
Due to limitations, the way the extension calculates the subscription rate is: 

`Current subscriptions / Unique visitors`
